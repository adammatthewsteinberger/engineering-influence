# Testing

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is the source of truth. These are its jobs and how to run each locally.

```bash
uv sync --extra test --extra runtime --extra dev --extra publishing
```

| Gate | Command | What it enforces |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` | style and common errors, including `examples/` |
| Architecture | `uv run lint-imports` | inward-only layers; services and controllers never touch adapters or transports |
| Security lint | `uv run bandit -q -r src packages` | common insecure patterns |
| Dependencies | `uv run pip-audit` | known vulnerabilities (the two local packages are reported as unauditable; that is expected) |
| Types | `uv run mypy --strict src packages` | strict typing |
| Tests | `uv run pytest --cov --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=100` | all tests and **100% branch coverage** |
| Compose smoke | `sh examples/compose_smoke.sh` | the real stack: credentials refused, a two-stage pipeline completes, a malformed message is dead-lettered, the curl example works |
| Provenance | `vibey-gh check --ci`; on pull requests `vibey-gh provenance-check` and `conventional-check` | file headers, `Made-With:` trailers, Conventional Commit subjects |
| Leak scan | gitleaks plus a path check | no secrets and no private-content paths in history |
| Workflows | `actionlint`, `zizmor` | workflow correctness and security |
| Distribution | built in CI | wheel and sdist install and run; `py.typed` ships |

## Test layout

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit` | one module at a time, with in-memory adapters |
| `tests/architecture` | the structural rules: one class per file, interfaces folders, no loose functions |
| `tests/parity` | every interface (API, MCP, CLI, SDK) gives the same result for the same input |
| `tests/e2e` | real processes: the CLI, the examples against a live uvicorn server, wheel installation |

## The examples are tests

`tests/e2e/test_examples.py` runs every script in `examples/` as a subprocess. The API,
SDK, curl and observability scripts hit a real uvicorn server on a free port; the MCP client
spawns the real stdio server; the webhook sender talks to the real receiver. The compose smoke test then
runs the curl example against the full stack. If you change an interface, the examples fail first.

## Coverage notes

- The 100% gate includes branches. Code that only runs in a fresh interpreter (missing optional
  extras) is measured through `patch = ["subprocess"]` in `[tool.coverage.run]`; do not remove it.
- Tests marked for a TeX toolchain are deselected by default (`pytest` reports "deselected").

## Writing tests

- Prefer a fake adapter behind a port over a mock of a library.
- Anything that crosses a process boundary needs a failure and recovery test, not only the happy path.
- Property tests use `hypothesis`; keep strategies small so the suite stays near a minute.
